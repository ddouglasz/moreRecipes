# more-recipes
An Andela bootcamp web app project for food recipes and reviews. My name is douglas and I am building My own version of the more-recipes app. The goal of this app is to build a full stack web app to speed up the skills of the individual in building both the frontend and backend of a web application.

What?
More-Recipes​ provides a platform for users to share the awesome and exciting recipe ideas they
have invented or learnt. Suppose a user comes up with a recipe, he/she can post it on
More-Recipes​ and get feedback in form of reviews and votes from other users who explore that
recipe. Users can also keep a list of their favorite recipes on the application.

How?
This project is broken down into challenges and completion of all phases would contribute
greatly to your learning towards becoming a full-stack developer. Upon completion, you would
have built a world-class full-stack (front-end and back-end) JS application.
Why?
Andela distributes opportunities. We disseminate Learning and catalyse Technology leadership.
The project is founded on the premise that aspiring Technology Leaders learn programming
whilst building things that matter and that the best way to learn is by building a complete product.
This​ ​project​ ​has​ ​one​ ​objective:​ create opportunities for learning where they build real products.
In this way, we inspire change in the African tech landscape.
